# nominee-mastra

## 3.0.0

### Patch Changes

- 833a7af: Document the out-of-band approval path — the approval that outlives the request. New
  site page at `nominee.dev/docs/approvals` with the four-step flow (catch
  `ActionPendingError` and persist the action id and the original input,
  `resolveActionApproval()`, `resumeAction()`, `executeCapability()`); a compressed
  four-step section in the core README quickstart; a "What happens on `ask`"
  subsection in every adapter README; and `examples/support-refund-agent` named as the
  canonical reference implementation.
- c53fc13: Repositioned the package surfaces around the pause narrative: npm package
  descriptions now lead with the consequence of approvals that outlive the
  request — a token minted at execution, bound to the arguments a human
  reviewed, spendable once, sealed into a hash-chained receipt — instead of a
  capability list. The core and adapter READMEs align with the same story,
  budget examples use `maxCalls` (lifetime call count, no time window, never
  resets, escalates to `ask` on exhaustion), and every tamper-evidence claim
  now carries its trust boundary (tamper-evident against a downstream log
  editor, not non-repudiation against the agent host).

## 2.3.0

### Patch Changes

- 2d8a966: Add observe mode: a first-class, report-only mode over your existing tools.

  `new Nominee({ mode: 'observe' })` plus `nominee.observe(tools)` needs no
  policy and does not enforce deny, ask, or budget decisions. Runtime and
  integrity failures still fail closed. Policy verdicts are recorded into the
  same hash-chained receipts before execution continues, so you can find out what
  an agent actually does before deciding what it should be allowed to do.
  `nominee.observations()` returns a JSON report (callbacks that actually started,
  argument types and observed ranges, fingerprint-based bounded cardinality,
  which arguments are unbounded, and what a policy would have said) without
  retaining raw string/boolean values or user IDs. Numeric samples and aggregates
  are bounded but can be sensitive. `formatObservations()` prints the report.

  Observe mode is a discovery tool, not a security control, and the safety rails
  say so: enforcement remains the default, `production: true` refuses to combine
  with it, startup emits an unmissable notice that enforcement is off, every
  receipt and audit event carries `enforcement: 'observe'` alongside the verdict
  the policy actually reached, and delegated sub-agents inherit the mode rather
  than choosing it. Input binding, single-use capabilities, and the receipt chain
  are unchanged.

  `npx nominee-cli observe` demonstrates it on a sample agent, with `--out <file>`
  to write the JSON report.

## 2.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 9f2e7d3: Fix `npx nominee-cli` crashing on launch. The published `nominee@2.2.0` core
  package predates the `formatReceipts` export that `nominee-cli@2.2.0` already
  depends on, so every invocation of the CLI (`npx nominee-cli`, `verify`,
  `check`) currently throws `SyntaxError: The requested module 'nominee' does
not provide an export named 'formatReceipts'` against the live npm registry.
  This changeset republishes the linked package set so the CLI's dependency is
  satisfied again. No source changes beyond the version bump — `formatReceipts`
  has been present in `packages/core/src` since it was added; it was simply
  never carried forward into a new npm release.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 227d887: Add the decision-bound action lifecycle, atomic durable PostgreSQL stores,
  verified resumable CIBA approvals, execution outcomes, privacy-safe usage
  measurement, and first-class OpenAI Agents, Mastra, and MCP adapters.
