# nominee-cli

## 2.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 9f2e7d3: Fix `npx nominee-cli` crashing on launch. The published `nominee@2.2.0` core
  package predates the `formatReceipts` export that `nominee-cli@2.2.0` already
  depends on, so every invocation of the CLI (`npx nominee-cli`, `verify`,
  `check`) currently throws `SyntaxError: The requested module 'nominee' does
not provide an export named 'formatReceipts'` against the live npm registry.
  This changeset republishes the linked package set so the CLI's dependency is
  satisfied again. No source changes beyond the version bump — `formatReceipts`
  has been present in `packages/core/src` since it was added; it was simply
  never carried forward into a new npm release.
