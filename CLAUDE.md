# CLAUDE.md

This repo's guidance for coding agents lives in **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)** —
read it first. It covers what nominee is, the two non-negotiable design
commitments (install-and-go default; dependency-free core), the monorepo layout,
the public API, commands, conventions, and the hard-won gotchas.

Live build status and the remaining work checklist are in
**[PROGRESS.md](./PROGRESS.md)**. The approved implementation plan is at
`~/.claude/plans/then-create-a-plan-bright-penguin.md`.

## Quick orientation

- **What it is:** provider-neutral identity + token delegation for AI agents.
  Fresh third-party tokens at call time, human-in-the-loop approval, audit.
- **Default path = no signup:** `new Nominee({ strategy: ({connection}) => process.env[...] })`.
  Auth0 (`@nominee/auth0`) is the optional managed upgrade (Token Vault + CIBA).
- **Packages:** `nominee` (core, zero deps) · `@nominee/ai` (Vercel AI SDK, also
  Cloudflare) · `@nominee/eve` (Vercel Eve) · `@nominee/auth0` (optional).

## Before you commit

```bash
pnpm -r build && pnpm -r test && pnpm -r typecheck && pnpm biome check .
```

All four must be green (currently: 53 tests passing). Keep the core
dependency-free and the public API tiny — DX/AX is a stated product priority.
