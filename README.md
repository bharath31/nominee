## The Problem

You authorized the agent at **9am**. By **3pm**, the GitHub token has expired — but the agent is still running in a Durable Object, pausing for human input, or looping over a massive codebase.

```
❌ 401 Unauthorized — silent failures in long-running agents
```

An agent acting on behalf of a user needs a **fresh** third-party token at the exact moment of a tool call. Sometimes that action is sensitive and needs human approval. It always needs an audit trail.

**nominee** is the provider-neutral layer that solves this — the *"Passport.js of agent auth."*

## How It Works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent
    participant Nominee
    participant Cache
    participant Strategy
    participant API as Third-party API

    Agent->>Nominee: nominee.token({ user, connection })
    Nominee->>Cache: check cache (user + connection)
    alt token is fresh
        Cache-->>Nominee: return cached token
    else token expired or missing
        Nominee->>Strategy: getToken(user, connection)
        Strategy-->>Nominee: fresh token + expiry
        Nominee->>Cache: store until near-expiry
    end
    Nominee-->>Agent: fresh token
    Agent->>API: make API call with token
```

---

## Installation

```bash
npm i nominee
```

No signup. No SaaS account. No vendor lock-in.

---

## Quickstart

```ts
import { Nominee, tokens } from 'nominee'

const nominee = new Nominee({
  // Provide a function that fetches tokens — from your DB, env vars, anywhere
  strategy: tokens(async ({ user, connection }) =>
    db.getFreshToken(user, connection)
  ),

  // Optional: audit every token fetch and approval
  onAudit: (e) => console.log(`[${e.type}] agent=${e.agent} user=${e.user}`),

  agent: 'triage-bot',
})

// Always call at request time — nominee handles caching & refresh automatically
const token = await nominee.token({ user: 'alice', connection: 'github' })
```

> **Design rule:** never cache the token yourself. Call `nominee.token()` at call time, every time. nominee handles freshness transparently.

---

## Human-in-the-Loop Approvals

Gate any agent action behind a real-time human approval — independent of the LLM or framework.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent
    participant Nominee
    participant User

    Agent->>Nominee: nominee.approve({ user, action, detail })
    Nominee->>User: onApprovalRequest fires → push notification / Slack / UI
    Note over Nominee,User: Execution is paused ⏸

    alt User approves
        User->>Nominee: resolveApproval(id, 'approved')
        Nominee-->>Agent: ✅ resolves — agent continues
    else User denies / timeout
        User->>Nominee: resolveApproval(id, 'denied')
        Nominee-->>Agent: ❌ throws ApprovalDeniedError
    end
```

```ts
// Gate an action — blocks until user responds
await nominee.approve({
  user: 'alice',
  action: 'repo.delete',
  detail: 'Delete repo: alice/old-project',
})

// From your webhook (Slack button, push notification, UI)
nominee.resolveApproval(approvalId, 'approved') // or 'denied'
```

---

## Framework Adapters

Nominee plugs directly into your AI framework's tool system.

| Adapter | Package | Links |
|---|---|---|
| **Vercel AI SDK** | `nominee-ai` | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/nominee-ai?style=flat-square&colorA=0a0a0f&colorB=3b82f6)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nominee-ai) |
| **Vercel Eve** | `nominee-eve` | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/nominee-eve?style=flat-square&colorA=0a0a0f&colorB=10b981)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nominee-eve) |
| **Cloudflare Agents** | `nominee-ai` | Uses the AI SDK adapter |
| **Standalone Node** | `nominee` | Built-in |

---

## Strategies

| Strategy | Use case |
|---|---|
| `tokens(fn)` | Simple function — env vars, your DB, a literal string |
| `OAuth2({ connections })` | Generic OAuth2 refresh-token flow, zero deps |
| `Memory({ tokens })` | Dev & test in-memory store |
| [`nominee-supabase`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nominee-supabase) | Read & refresh provider tokens stored in Supabase *(optional)* |
| [`nominee-auth0`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nominee-auth0) | Auth0 Token Vault + CIBA push approvals *(optional)* |

---

## Auth0 — Optional Managed Upgrade

Don't want to manage refresh tokens yourself? `nominee-auth0` uses Auth0's Token Vault and CIBA (Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication) to handle everything automatically.

```bash
npm i nominee nominee-auth0
```

```ts
import { Nominee } from 'nominee'
import { Auth0 } from 'nominee-auth0'

const nominee = new Nominee({
  strategy: Auth0({
    domain: 'your-tenant.us.auth0.com',
    clientId: process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET,
    subjectToken: ({ user }) => sessionStore.getRefreshToken(user),
    ciba: { bindingMessage: (req) => `Approve: ${req.action}` },
  }),
})
```

> Auth0 is entirely optional. The core has zero dependencies and zero lock-in.

---

## Full API

```ts
// Fetch a fresh token (cached, auto-refreshed)
await nominee.token({ user, connection })

// Gate on human approval — throws ApprovalDeniedError if denied/expired
await nominee.approve({ user, action, detail })

// Settle an approval from your webhook
nominee.resolveApproval(id, 'approved' | 'denied')

// Fine-grained authorization (throws unless strategy implements it)
await nominee.can({ user, action, resource })

// Drop the cached token for a user+connection (force re-resolve next call)
nominee.invalidate(user, connection)

// Spawn a sub-agent — its audit events carry user → orchestrator → sub-agent
const researcher = nominee.delegate('research-agent')
await researcher.token({ user, connection }) // shares the parent cache + audit stream

// Exchange for a downscoped token bound to a sub-agent (RFC 8693; needs strategy support)
await nominee.exchange({ user, connection, actor: 'research-agent', scopes })

// Subscribe to all audit events
const unsub = nominee.on((event) => console.log(event))
```

## Why nominee

The hard part of agent auth isn't the OAuth dance — it's keeping a token *fresh across a long run*, gating the risky calls, and proving who authorized what. nominee does all three, in one provider-neutral layer.

| Capability | nominee | AI SDK / CF Agents / LangChain | Auth0 (alone) |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Fresh token at execution time | ✅ | you write it | ✅ (vendor-locked) |
| Survives durable hibernation | ✅ | you write it | ✅ (vendor-locked) |
| Provider-neutral (swap vendors) | ✅ | — | — |
| Zero-signup to start | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Human-in-the-loop approval | ✅ | AI SDK ✅, others — | — |
| Audit log | ✅ | — | partial |

> **When you don't need nominee:** single-provider, short-lived, non-durable app → your IdP's SDK or ~20 lines is enough. nominee pays off for long-running, durable, multi-provider agents, or when you refuse lock-in.

---

## "Doesn't the AI SDK already have approvals?"

Yes — AI SDK v6 added tool approvals. Nominee adds three things it doesn't cover:

1. **Token lifecycle** — tool calls happen hours after authorization. Nominee manages refresh so you never pass a stale token.
2. **Provider-neutral** — works with Cloudflare Agents, Eve, standalone loops — not just the AI SDK.
3. **Unified audit trail** — one stream across all agents, all frameworks.
